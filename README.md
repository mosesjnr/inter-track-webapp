# inter-track-webapp

The task is to build a webapp for rent prediction in Lagos.

As an inter-track project, it involves the UI/UX team, SWE and data science group.

As part of the data science team, our task includes:
- scrape data from two property sites in Lagos
- Perform exploratory analysis on gathered data
- Develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the rent in Lagos
- Build an API to help the SWE team integrate the model into the backend of their software.

I don't know about you but, I'd love to know the estimated cost of rent in a place like Maryland, Lagos.

Where would you love to find a house whenever you find yourself in Lagos? 

Maybe I could help with the estimated rental price.
