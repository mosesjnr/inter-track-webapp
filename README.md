# inter-track-webapp

The project is an inter-track project that involves collaboration between the Software team, UI/UX team and the Data Science team for which i was a part of.

It involves building an application that can predict the rent of houses in Lagos State, Nigeria.

We limited our scope to location and number of bedrooms(1-3rooms)

As part of the data science team, our task includes:
- scrape data from two property sites in Lagos
- Perform exploratory analysis on gathered data
- Develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the rent in Lagos
- Build an API to help the SWE team integrate the model into the backend of their software.

I don't know about you but, I'd love to know the estimated cost of rent in a place like Maryland, Lagos.

Where would you love to find a house whenever you find yourself in Lagos? 

Maybe I could help with the estimated rental price.
